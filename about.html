        <h1>About LootRadar</h1>
        <p class="meta">Helping gamers save money since 2025</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>PC gaming shouldn't be expensive. Between Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, Humble Bundle, Fanatical, Green Man Gaming, and dozens of other authorized retailers, the same game can have wildly different prices at the same time. The problem isn't a lack of deals &mdash; it's that nobody has time to check 15 stores before every purchase.</p>

        <p>That's why we built <strong>LootRadar</strong>. One page. Every store. Every deal. Updated daily so you always know the lowest price for any PC game.</p>

        <h2>How LootRadar Works</h2>
        <p>LootRadar is a game deal aggregator powered by the <a href="https://www.cheapshark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CheapShark API</a>, which tracks pricing data from 30+ authorized PC game retailers. Here's what happens when you visit:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>We pull live data</strong> from every major PC game store &mdash; Steam, Epic, GOG, Humble Bundle, Fanatical, Green Man Gaming, GamersGate, and many more.</li>
            <li><strong>We organize it</strong> so you can filter by price, discount percentage, store, genre, and user ratings.</li>
            <li><strong>We highlight the best deals</strong> using deal ratings based on historical pricing, so you can tell if a "50% off" is genuinely good or just marketing.</li>
            <li><strong>We link directly to the store</strong> &mdash; when you find a deal you want, one click takes you straight to the retailer's checkout page.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>No accounts required. No apps to install. No tracking beyond basic, privacy-friendly analytics (we use <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoatCounter</a> &mdash; no cookies, no personal data).</p>

        <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
        <p>There are other deal sites out there. Here's why people choose LootRadar:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>No clutter.</strong> We focus on what matters: the game, the price, the store, and the link. No forums, no social features, no bloat.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile-first.</strong> LootRadar is a Progressive Web App (PWA). Install it on your phone and check deals on the go, just like a native app.</li>
            <li><strong>Free forever.</strong> LootRadar is completely free to use. We earn a small commission through affiliate links when you click through to a store and make a purchase. This never affects the prices you see.</li>
            <li><strong>Original content.</strong> Our <a href="blog.html">blog</a> publishes weekly guides, deal roundups, and budget gaming tips written by real gamers who actually care about saving money on games.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The LootRadar Team</h2>
        <p>We're a small team of gamers and developers who got tired of overpaying for games. Between us, we've probably spent (and saved) thousands of dollars on PC games over the years. We built LootRadar as the tool we wished existed &mdash; and now we maintain it for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Is LootRadar free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, completely free. We earn revenue through affiliate links &mdash; when you click a deal and buy a game, we get a small commission at no extra cost to you.</p>

        <h3>Are the deals legitimate?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We only track authorized retailers. Every store in our system sells legitimate game keys or direct downloads. We never list grey market key resellers.</p>

        <h3>How often are prices updated?</h3>
        <p>Deal data refreshes daily through the CheapShark API, which continuously monitors pricing across all tracked stores.</p>

        <h3>Can I request a feature?</h3>
        <p>We'd love to hear from you! Reach out at <strong>contact@thelootradar.com</strong> with suggestions, bug reports, or just to say hi.</p>
