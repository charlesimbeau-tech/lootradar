        <h1>25 Amazing Indie Games Under $5 You Need to Play</h1>
        <p class="meta">Published: February 17, 2026 &middot; 13 min read &middot; By the LootRadar Team</p>

        <p>Five dollars. That's less than a fancy coffee, less than a fast food combo, and less than a single month of most streaming services. Yet for $5 or less, you can buy indie games that deliver 20, 50, even 100+ hours of entertainment. Games that win awards. Games that make you cry. Games that keep you up until 3 AM whispering "just one more run."</p>

        <p>We've curated 25 of the best indie games that regularly sell for under $5 (either at their base price or during frequent sales). Every game on this list has strong user reviews and is genuinely worth your time. No filler, no padding &mdash; just great games at absurd prices.</p>

        <p>Want to check current prices? <a href="../index.html">LootRadar</a> compares deals across 15+ stores in real time, so you can find the absolute lowest price for any game on this list.</p>

        <h2>Roguelikes and Roguelites</h2>

        <h3>1. Vampire Survivors &mdash; $2.99 (often $1.49 on sale)</h3>
        <p>The game that spawned an entire subgenre. You walk around a field while hordes of enemies approach from every direction, and your weapons fire automatically. It sounds braindead. It's not. The build variety, the dopamine loop of leveling up, and the progression system across runs make this one of the most addictive games ever made. At $2.99, it's practically a crime.</p>

        <h3>2. Slay the Spire &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>The deckbuilding roguelike that defined the genre. Build a deck of cards, fight through procedurally generated encounters, and try to reach the top of the spire. Four characters, each with completely different playstyles. Simple to learn, nearly impossible to master, and endlessly replayable. Over 100 hours is common.</p>

        <h3>3. Into the Breach &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>From the creators of FTL, this is a turn-based mech tactics game where you can see exactly what the enemy will do next turn. There's no randomness in combat &mdash; just pure, brain-melting strategy. Every decision matters. Compact runs take 30-60 minutes, making it perfect for quick sessions.</p>

        <h3>4. FTL: Faster Than Light &mdash; $2.49 on sale</h3>
        <p>Manage a spaceship and its crew as you flee across the galaxy, making desperate decisions at every jump. Run out of fuel? Lose your weapons officer to a fire? Get boarded by alien mantises? All in a day's work. A decade old and still completely unmatched in its niche.</p>

        <h3>5. Risk of Rain 2 &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>Third-person roguelike shooter where items stack multiplicatively until you become an absurd god of destruction. Best played with friends in co-op, but perfectly viable solo. The sense of escalation from "barely surviving" to "one-shotting everything" is unmatched.</p>

        <h2>Platformers and Action Games</h2>

        <h3>6. Celeste &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>A precision platformer about climbing a mountain, both literally and metaphorically. The gameplay is tight, responsive, and challenging without being punishing (generous checkpoints, instant respawns). But what elevates Celeste from "great platformer" to "masterpiece" is its story about anxiety, self-doubt, and perseverance. You'll cry. You'll also die 3,000 times. Both are worth it.</p>

        <h3>7. Hollow Knight &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>A Metroidvania with 40-80 hours of content, gorgeous hand-drawn art, haunting music, and some of the best boss fights in gaming. The fact that this game costs $15 at full price is already absurd &mdash; at $4.99 on sale, it's one of the greatest value propositions in gaming history. Team Cherry somehow made a game that competes with $60 titles on a tiny budget.</p>

        <h3>8. Dead Cells &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>A roguevania (roguelike + Metroidvania) with buttery-smooth combat, dozens of weapons, and a progression system that keeps you pushing forward. The developers have released massive free content updates for years after launch. Fast, brutal, and deeply satisfying.</p>

        <h3>9. Katana ZERO &mdash; $4.49 on sale</h3>
        <p>A neon-soaked action platformer where you clear rooms of enemies in slow-motion, one-hit-kill precision. Think Hotline Miami meets a cyberpunk samurai anime. The story is surprisingly compelling, with branching dialogue and a protagonist whose perception of reality is... unreliable. Short but unforgettable.</p>

        <h3>10. Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>A retro platformer that pays homage to the NES era while modernizing everything that needed modernizing. The Treasure Trove edition includes four complete campaigns, each with unique mechanics. It's essentially four excellent games for the price of a coffee.</p>

        <h2>Narrative and Story-Driven Games</h2>

        <h3>11. Undertale &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>The RPG where you don't have to kill anyone. Toby Fox created something genuinely unique &mdash; a game that's aware it's a game, that remembers your choices across playthroughs, and that delivers one of the most emotionally devastating experiences in gaming. The retro graphics hide a level of narrative sophistication that most AAA games can't touch.</p>

        <h3>12. To the Moon &mdash; $2.49 on sale</h3>
        <p>A narrative adventure about two doctors who traverse a dying man's memories to fulfill his last wish: to go to the moon. It's short (4-5 hours), it looks like an RPG Maker game, and it will absolutely destroy you emotionally. One of the most touching stories in any medium, not just games.</p>

        <h3>13. Oxenfree &mdash; $3.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>A supernatural thriller about a group of friends who accidentally open a ghostly rift on an abandoned island. The dialogue system is naturalistic and seamless &mdash; characters talk over each other, conversations branch organically. Atmosphere, writing, and voice acting are all outstanding.</p>

        <h3>14. Night in the Woods &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>A narrative adventure about a college dropout who returns to her dying hometown. Explores themes of mental health, economic anxiety, and growing up. Funny, heartfelt, and uncomfortably real. The characters feel like people you know.</p>

        <h3>15. A Short Hike &mdash; $3.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>A tiny open-world game about a bird hiking up a mountain. Takes about 2-3 hours. That's it. And somehow it's one of the most joyful, peaceful gaming experiences you'll ever have. Perfect when you need a break from everything else.</p>

        <h2>Strategy and Simulation</h2>

        <h3>16. Stardew Valley &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>Farming sim perfection. Plant crops, raise animals, mine for ore, fish, befriend townspeople, get married, and lose hundreds of hours of your life. Created entirely by one person (Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone), Stardew Valley has received massive free content updates for years. The amount of content here for under $5 is staggering.</p>

        <h3>17. Terraria &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>2D sandbox adventure with absurd depth. Mine, build, fight bosses, explore biomes, craft hundreds of items, and discover secrets. Re-Logic has released enormous free updates for over a decade. Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam with 1 million+ reviews. At under $5, this might be the best value in all of gaming.</p>

        <h3>18. Papers, Please &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>You're an immigration inspector in a fictional dystopian country. Check documents, stamp passports, catch discrepancies. Sounds boring. It's not. It's a tense, morally complex experience that forces impossible choices. Do you let the desperate refugee through with forged papers, or do you follow the rules so your family doesn't starve?</p>

        <h3>19. Mini Metro &mdash; $2.49 on sale</h3>
        <p>Design a subway map for a growing city. Passengers appear at stations and need to reach specific shapes. You draw lines, add trains, and try to keep everything flowing as demand increases. Minimalist, elegant, and deeply strategic. Perfect for mobile or desktop.</p>

        <h3>20. Baba Is You &mdash; $4.49 on sale</h3>
        <p>A puzzle game where the rules of each level are physical objects you can push around. "BABA IS YOU" means you control Baba. Push the words around to make "WALL IS STOP" become "WALL IS YOU" and now you're the wall. It breaks your brain in the best possible way. Genuinely one of the most innovative puzzle games ever created.</p>

        <h2>Horror and Atmosphere</h2>

        <h3>21. Limbo &mdash; $2.49 on sale</h3>
        <p>A boy wanders through a monochrome nightmare, solving physics puzzles and dying in increasingly disturbing ways. No dialogue, no HUD, no color &mdash; just atmosphere and dread. It's short (3-4 hours), and every minute is perfectly crafted.</p>

        <h3>22. Inside &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>The spiritual successor to Limbo, from the same studio (Playdead). A boy runs through a dystopian world filled with mind-controlled humans and industrial horror. The ending is one of the most talked-about moments in gaming. Visually stunning, mechanically tight, emotionally haunting.</p>

        <h3>23. Phasmophobia &mdash; $4.49 on sale</h3>
        <p>Co-op ghost hunting with friends. Use real ghost-hunting equipment (EMF readers, spirit boxes, UV lights) to identify what type of ghost is haunting a location. The VR support is excellent, and the game has received constant updates since its explosive Early Access launch. Genuinely terrifying.</p>

        <h2>Multiplayer and Party Games</h2>

        <h3>24. Among Us &mdash; $3.99 (often cheaper on sale)</h3>
        <p>The social deduction phenomenon. Complete tasks on a space station while trying to identify the impostor(s) among your crew. Best played with friends over voice chat. The game that launched a million memes, and it's still genuinely fun.</p>

        <h3>25. Lethal Company &mdash; $4.99 on sale</h3>
        <p>Co-op horror meets corporate satire. You and your friends are employees of "The Company," scavenging abandoned moons for valuable scrap to meet your profit quota. The monsters are terrifying, the junk you collect is hilariously mundane, and the voice chat proximity system creates unforgettable moments of panic.</p>
