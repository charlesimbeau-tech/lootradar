        <h1>How to Compare Game Prices Across Every PC Store</h1>
        <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026 · By the LootRadar team</p>

        <p>You want to buy a game. You check Steam. The price looks fine. You buy it. Two days later, you discover it was 40% cheaper on Fanatical. Sound familiar?</p>

        <p>PC gaming has a pricing problem — not because games are too expensive, but because the same game can have wildly different prices across different stores <em>at the same time</em>. If you're only checking one store, you're almost certainly overpaying.</p>

        <p>This guide explains why prices differ, which stores matter, and how to compare prices without losing your mind.</p>

        <h2>Why Do Game Prices Differ Across Stores?</h2>

        <p>Unlike console games — where Sony or Microsoft control the storefront — PC game distribution is a free market. Dozens of stores compete for your money, and they use different strategies to win it.</p>

        <h3>Different Revenue Splits</h3>
        <p>Steam takes a 30% cut from developers. Epic takes 12%. GOG takes around 30% but offers DRM-free games. These different revenue shares mean publishers can sometimes offer lower base prices on stores that take smaller cuts — though most choose to keep prices consistent and pocket the difference.</p>

        <h3>Exclusive Sales and Coupons</h3>
        <p>Stores run independent sales on their own schedules. Fanatical might discount a game this week while Steam waits until next month. Green Man Gaming might offer a blanket 20% coupon. Humble Bundle subscribers get an extra 20% off on the Humble Store. These discounts stack and overlap in unpredictable ways.</p>

        <h3>Regional Pricing</h3>
        <p>Some stores adjust prices by region more aggressively than others. A game might cost $60 on one store and $45 on another, both legitimately, based on regional pricing agreements with the publisher.</p>

        <h3>Key Resellers vs. Direct Stores</h3>
        <p>Authorized key retailers (Fanatical, Green Man Gaming, Humble) buy keys from publishers at wholesale prices and sell them at whatever price makes sense. This means they can sometimes undercut the publisher's own store pricing — legally and legitimately.</p>

        <h2>Every PC Game Store You Should Know About</h2>

        <p>Here are the major stores worth checking, and what makes each one unique:</p>

        <h3>The Big Three</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Steam</strong> — The default. Biggest library, best community features, most frequent sales. But not always the cheapest.</li>
            <li><strong>Epic Games Store</strong> — Smaller library, but aggressive pricing. Weekly free games. Occasional exclusive discounts and coupons.</li>
            <li><strong>GOG</strong> — Every game is DRM-free. Strong classic game library. Good sales, especially on older titles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Retailers (Authorized)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Humble Bundle</strong> — Bundles, monthly subscription with extra discounts, and a standalone store. A portion of every purchase goes to charity.</li>
            <li><strong>Fanatical</strong> — Frequent flash deals and bundles. Often has the lowest price on specific titles.</li>
            <li><strong>Green Man Gaming</strong> — Solid sales, VIP pricing for loyal customers, and a loyalty XP system that unlocks better deals.</li>
            <li><strong>GamersGate</strong> — European retailer with competitive prices, especially during their seasonal sales.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Publisher Stores</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>EA App</strong> — Required for EA games anyway. EA Play subscription is cheap for access to their back catalog.</li>
            <li><strong>Ubisoft Connect</strong> — Ubisoft's store. Occasionally has exclusive discounts, plus a loyalty coin system.</li>
            <li><strong>Xbox/Microsoft Store</strong> — Game Pass makes this worth checking even for PC gamers. Some games are cheaper here.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Problem With Manual Price Checking</h2>

        <p>Let's be honest: nobody is going to open 10 browser tabs every time they want to buy a game. You'd spend more time comparing prices than actually playing. And by the time you've checked everywhere, the deal you found first might have expired.</p>

        <p>This is exactly why game price comparison tools exist. They do the tedious work automatically, pulling prices from multiple stores and showing you the lowest one.</p>

        <h2>How LootRadar Makes Price Comparison Effortless</h2>

        <p><a href="https://thelootradar.com/">LootRadar</a> is a game deal aggregator that pulls live pricing data from 15+ authorized PC game stores using the CheapShark API. Here's what that means in practice:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>One page, every deal.</strong> Instead of checking Steam, then Epic, then Fanatical, then GOG — you see every active deal in one place, sorted by discount percentage or price.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-time data.</strong> Prices update throughout the day. When a flash sale starts on Fanatical at 2 AM, it shows up immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Deal ratings.</strong> Not all "80% off" deals are created equal. LootRadar shows deal ratings based on historical pricing so you can tell if a discount is genuinely good or just marketing fluff.</li>
            <li><strong>Filter by store.</strong> Want to see only Steam deals? Only GOG? Only games under $5? Filter and sort however you want.</li>
            <li><strong>Free games highlighted.</strong> Every 100% discount — every free giveaway — is surfaced automatically. Check our guide to <a href="best-free-pc-games.html">the best free PC games</a> for more on that.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Price Comparison Tips From Experienced Bargain Hunters</h2>

        <h3>1. Never Buy at Launch (Unless You Must)</h3>
        <p>Most games drop 30-50% within 3-6 months of release. If you're not desperate to play on day one, waiting even a few weeks can save you serious money. Check <a href="https://thelootradar.com/">LootRadar</a> periodically to catch the first discount.</p>

        <h3>2. Stack Discounts</h3>
        <p>Some stores allow coupon stacking. Epic occasionally offers $10 off coupons during sales. Humble subscribers get 20% off store purchases. Green Man Gaming's VIP program unlocks extra discounts. These can combine with existing sales for absurdly low prices.</p>

        <h3>3. Check Before Every Purchase</h3>
        <p>Make it a habit. Before buying any game, spend 10 seconds on <a href="https://thelootradar.com/">LootRadar</a> to see if it's cheaper somewhere else. You'll be surprised how often it is.</p>

        <h3>4. Seasonal Sales Are Predictable</h3>
        <p>Steam's major sales happen like clockwork. If a game is only 20% off in a random mid-week deal, it'll probably be 50%+ off during the Summer or Winter sale. Patience pays — literally.</p>

        <h3>5. Don't Ignore Bundles</h3>
        <p>Humble Bundle, Fanatical bundles, and GOG bundles can get you 5-10 games for the price of one. Even if you only want two games in a bundle, the math often works out better than buying them individually.</p>

        <h2>Stop Overpaying for Games</h2>

        <p>The PC gaming market is competitive, and that competition benefits you — but only if you take advantage of it. Buying every game from a single store is like shopping at one grocery store without ever checking prices elsewhere. You're leaving money on the table.</p>

        <p>Price comparison doesn't have to be work. With <a href="https://thelootradar.com/">LootRadar</a>, it takes seconds. One page. Every store. Every deal. No accounts required, no apps to install — just open the site and find the cheapest price.</p>

        <div class="cta-box">
