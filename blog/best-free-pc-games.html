        <h1>Best Free PC Games Right Now (Updated Weekly)</h1>
        <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026 · By the LootRadar team</p>

        <p>Free games aren't what they used to be — they're better. Between Epic Games Store giving away blockbusters every Thursday, Steam running surprise giveaways, and an ever-growing roster of genuinely excellent free-to-play titles, there's never been a better time to game on a budget of exactly zero dollars.</p>

        <p>We maintain this list weekly so you always know what's free <em>right now</em>. If you want real-time tracking without checking back manually, <a href="https://thelootradar.com/">LootRadar</a> monitors every free deal across 15+ stores and surfaces them automatically.</p>

        <h2>This Week's Free Game Giveaways</h2>

        <p>Every week, storefronts give away games you can claim and keep forever. The catch? They're only free for a limited window. Miss it, and you're paying full price.</p>

        <h3>Epic Games Store Weekly Freebies</h3>
        <p>Epic has given away over $10,000 worth of games since 2018. Every Thursday at 11 AM Eastern, a new title (sometimes two) goes free for a week. Past giveaways have included <strong>GTA V</strong>, <strong>Death Stranding</strong>, <strong>Civilization VI</strong>, and <strong>Control</strong>. Even if you don't play them immediately, claim them — they're yours permanently once added to your library.</p>

        <h3>Steam Free Promotions</h3>
        <p>Steam doesn't have a scheduled giveaway program, but publishers frequently run "free to keep" promotions — especially during seasonal sales or game anniversaries. Titles like <strong>Payday 2</strong>, <strong>For Honor</strong>, and <strong>Tomb Raider (2013)</strong> have all gone free on Steam at various points. The trick is catching them before the window closes.</p>

        <h3>GOG, Humble, and Others</h3>
        <p>GOG runs regular giveaways of DRM-free classics. Humble Bundle occasionally drops free games alongside their bundle promotions. Amazon Prime Gaming (included with Prime) offers 5-8 free games every single month, often including solid indie titles.</p>

        <h2>Best Free-to-Play Games Worth Your Time</h2>
        <p>Free-to-play has a reputation problem, and honestly, some of it is earned. But the best F2P games are genuinely world-class. Here are the ones actually worth installing:</p>

        <h3>Shooters</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Valorant</strong> — Riot's tactical 5v5 shooter combines CS-style gunplay with character abilities. Massively competitive, zero pay-to-win.</li>
            <li><strong>Apex Legends</strong> — Still one of the best battle royales. Excellent movement, strong gunplay, frequent updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Counter-Strike 2</strong> — The king of competitive shooters went free-to-play. Enough said.</li>
            <li><strong>The Finals</strong> — Destructible environments, game-show chaos, and surprisingly deep gunplay. A breath of fresh air.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>RPGs & Adventure</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genshin Impact</strong> — Open-world action RPG with jaw-dropping production values. Gacha monetization, but you can clear all content without spending a dime.</li>
            <li><strong>Path of Exile</strong> — The ARPG that many Diablo fans prefer. Deep, complex, rewarding — and Path of Exile 2 continues the tradition.</li>
            <li><strong>Warframe</strong> — Space ninja action with a staggering amount of content. The grind is real, but it's the good kind.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Strategy & Card Games</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dota 2</strong> — One of the deepest competitive games ever made. Steep learning curve, infinite ceiling.</li>
            <li><strong>League of Legends</strong> — The MOBA that defined the genre. Still going strong with regular champion releases.</li>
            <li><strong>Marvel Snap</strong> — Fast, clever card game with gorgeous art. Games take 3 minutes. Dangerously addictive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>MMOs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guild Wars 2</strong> — The core game is completely free. One of the most generous F2P models in any MMO.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Fantasy XIV Free Trial</strong> — Play through two full expansions (hundreds of hours) completely free. It's absurd how much content you get.</li>
            <li><strong>Star Wars: The Old Republic</strong> — All eight class stories are free. That's easily 200+ hours of BioWare RPG storytelling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Never Miss a Free Game Again</h2>
        <p>The problem with free games isn't finding them — it's finding them <em>in time</em>. Epic's Thursday drops are predictable, but Steam giveaways, GOG freebies, and publisher promotions pop up randomly.</p>

        <p>That's exactly why we built <a href="https://thelootradar.com/">LootRadar</a>. It pulls deals from 15+ stores in real time using the CheapShark API. Every 100% discount — every free game — shows up automatically. No accounts, no notifications to configure. Just open the site and see what's free right now.</p>

        <h2>Tips for Building a Free Game Library</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Claim everything, play later.</strong> Even if you're not interested now, add free games to your library. Future-you will thank present-you.</li>
            <li><strong>Check multiple stores.</strong> A game might be free on Epic but not Steam, or vice versa. <a href="https://thelootradar.com/">LootRadar</a> checks them all at once.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't sleep on Prime Gaming.</strong> If you already pay for Amazon Prime, you're leaving free games on the table every month.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch for franchise giveaways.</strong> When a sequel launches, publishers often make earlier entries free. It's marketing, and it's beautiful.</li>
            <li><strong>F2P doesn't mean low quality.</strong> Some of the most-played games on the planet are free. Don't skip them out of snobbery.</li>
        </ol>
